# Future/Promise Pattern

The Future/Promise pattern represents a value that may not be available yet but will be available at some point in the future. It's a way to handle asynchronous operations and their results in a clean and composable manner.

## Key Concepts
- Asynchronous computation with goroutines
- Result caching using channels
- Error handling with error channels
- Composition using select

## Implementation Details
- Uses channels for result delivery
- Implements context for cancellation
- Handles errors with separate channels
- Manages goroutine lifecycle
- Synchronizes with channels

## Use Cases
- Long-running computations (e.g., complex calculations, data processing)
- Network requests (e.g., HTTP calls, gRPC requests)
- File operations (e.g., reading large files, file compression)
- Database queries (e.g., complex joins, aggregations)
- Parallel processing (e.g., map-reduce operations)

## When to Use
- When you need to start a computation and get its result later
- When you want to handle multiple async operations
- When you need to implement timeouts for async operations
- When you want to chain async operations
- When you need to handle errors from async operations

## Example
[See implementation in main.go](main.go)

## ASCII Diagram
```
[Future] --> [Computation]
   |              |
   |              v
   |           [Result]
   |              |
   v              v
[Consumer] <-- [Value]
```

## Potential Pitfalls
1. Channel leaks if not properly closed
2. Goroutine leaks if not cancelled
3. Deadlocks if channels block
4. Memory issues with unbounded channels
5. Context cancellation handling

## Best Practices
1. Use context for cancellation
2. Close channels in defer statements
3. Handle errors properly
4. Monitor goroutine count
5. Use buffered channels when appropriate
6. Implement proper cleanup
