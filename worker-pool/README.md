# Worker Pool Pattern

The Worker Pool pattern manages a pool of worker goroutines to process tasks concurrently with controlled resource usage.

## Key Concepts
- Task distribution using channels
- Worker goroutine management
- Result collection
- Resource control

## Implementation Details
- Channel-based task distribution
- Worker lifecycle management
- Result aggregation
- Error handling

## Use Cases
- Task processing
- Resource management
- Load balancing
- Batch processing
- Parallel computation

## Example
[main.go](./main.go) demonstrates a simple worker pool implementation with:
- Task distribution to workers
- Result collection
- Worker lifecycle management
- Error handling

## ASCII Diagram
```
Tasks ----[task]----> Worker Pool ----[result]----> Results
  |          |           |                |            |
  |          |           v                |            |
  |          |       [workers]            |            |
  |          |           |                |            |
  v          v           v                v            v
[queue]   [assign]   [process]        [collect]   [aggregate]
```

## Potential Pitfalls
1. Channel leaks if not properly closed
2. Goroutine leaks if not cancelled
3. Deadlocks if channels block
4. Memory issues with unbounded channels
5. Context cancellation handling

## Best Practices
1. Use context for cancellation
2. Close channels in defer statements
3. Handle errors properly
4. Monitor goroutine count
5. Use buffered channels when appropriate
6. Implement proper cleanup
